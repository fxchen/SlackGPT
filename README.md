# SlackGPT

I created this starter application to explore interacting with OpenAI's ChatGPT
inside of Slack. I discovered ChatGPT is way more powerful than expected. It's
exciting, sometimes wrong, and delightful all at once.

Feedback loops with AI whereever we're working is a step-wise gain in
productivity. I want to help people leverage ChatGPT through Slack and other
tools.

- [Slack](https://slack.com/) is the place where work happens. Slack is an
  easy-to-use communication platform that helps teams stay organized,
  productive, and connected, no matter where they are. It allows users to
  communicate with each other in real-time, share files, and collaborate on
  projects. It also offers a variety of features, such as private messaging,
  group chat, and video conferencing.
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) is an AI-powered chatbot that can
  simulate natural conversations with users. It uses natural language processing
  and machine learning to understand user input and generate meaningful
  responses. Using ChatGPT, users can have conversations with a virtual
  assistant that is able to provide information and advice.
- Interacting with ChatGPT where you're working, like Slack or VSCode, is
  interesting because it allows you to stay focused and in the flow of your
  work. Imagine being able to get the benefits of ChatGPT ‚Äî asking questions,
  getting explanations, and receiving guidance ‚Äî without having to switch
  between applications to open the web interface. This makes it easier to stay
  on track and avoid distractions, which can help you be more productive.
  Additionally, the natural language processing capabilities of ChatGPT allow
  you to communicate with it in a way that feels intuitive and conversational,
  making it a useful tool for getting the information you need and a natural fit
  in a communication platform like Slack.

# Examples

Here's how I've used ChatGPT through Slack to start structuring ideas. The
direct output is not perfect, but a useful starting point.

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Take code to generate documentation
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Take a list of ingredients to generate a recipe
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Take a concept to generate a sequence diagram
- 4Ô∏è‚É£ Take a list of exercises and generate a training program
